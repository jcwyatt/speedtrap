# speedtrap
Python Coding Challenge 2


Create a program that takes a time for a car going past a speed camera, the time going past the next one and the distance between them to calculate the average speed for the car in mph. The cameras are one mile apart. 

Extensions:  

Speed cameras know the timings of each car going past, through number plate recognition. Valid number plates are two letters, two numbers and three more letters after a space, for example XX77 XVW. Produce a part of the program that checks whether a number plate matches the given pattern. Tell the user either way.  

Create a program for creating a file of details for vehicles exceeding the speed limit set for a section of road. You will need to create a suitable file with test data, including randomised number plates and times. You will then use the code youâ€™ve already written to process this list to determine who is breaking the speed limit (70mph) and who has invalid number plates.
